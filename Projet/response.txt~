We thank reviewers for their useful comments and suggestions.
In the response below, we refer to the review[er]s as R1-R3.

1) Constructiveness 


** R1: "It would be useful to see an explicit diagram that shows dependencies used in the
proof of Theorem 6 to make the algorithmic aspect clear, because this is,
after all the key contribution. In the current presentation this remains quite implicit, as the author says
"We can adapt it to get an algorithm ..", well, then do so in the paper ..., or else one could say the same thing about the earlier proofs, except that here the "adapt phase" is easier."

The presentation of the algorithm can certainly be improved by using a diagram,
 however the algorithm is accurately described in the proof of theorem 6. There is a confusion by R1 
about the following sentence: "We can adapt it to get an algorithm ..". The full sentence is: "The proof of  Theorem 6  describes an algorithm that outputs a Î¼LK proof for every valid formula. We can adapt it to get an algorithm that takes an arbitrary formula \phi and outputs either a proof of \phi if \phi is valid; or a word u \notin M(\phi)." In other words, we can improve our algorithm to get one  that does not only output proofs for valid formulas, but also counterexamples for non-valid ones. This adapted algorithm 
is described in the paragraph following the aforementioned sentence. 

To answer the second part of this comment, one cannot say the same thing about 
 earlier proofs, because in these proofs the algorithmic aspect is not hidden, but it is inexistent: their arguments rely on proofs by contradiction, and it is known to be difficult, when not impossible, to extract constructive and algorithmic content from proofs by contradiction. 




2) proofs

** R2: "I found myself wondering whether [the proofs] are as
simple as they seem, or whether the devil is in the detail"

The proofs are indeed easier than one can expect them to be. This is mainly due to the
structure of our proof. Indeed, we found an appropriate way to decompose the problem into simpler sub-problems,
 the proof of each being constructive and relatively easy. The difficulty was to unearth these sub-problems.
This is an improvement on earlier proofs, which are more intricate and more difficult to follow. 


** R2: "unfortunately there is no pointer to a full version of the proofs,
whether they are simple or not."

There is a pointer to a long version mentioned at the end of the introduction, which is reference [10] in the paper; this may have escaped to the notice of R2.
To clarify the level of detail of the proofs, all the key ingredients of the proofs are given, in such a way that a reader could infer the entire proof himself. Our goal was to convey enough conviction, leaving only
some computational steps aside.   

2) Presentation.

** R1: "- The five steps I-V in intro should be explained in words because some notation has not been introduced yet."

In these steps, $\cal{L}(A)$ means the language of the automaton A, and $\cal{M}(\phi)$
means the models of the formula $\phi$. I will explain them in words in the introduction.


3) Technical points.

** R1, Example 2: "I don't understand the point of this definition, why do you need tree vs graph [...]"

Having both definitions is not absolutely necessary, but simplifies the presentation in some areas. 
The tree of a formula is the standard graphical representation of a formula. But what we need more frequently is the notion of the graph, since the threads of a formula (which are a central object in this paper) can be seen as paths in the graph of this formula, and this is an intuition that is very helpful in understanding some proofs.

** R1, Example 4: "\rho_1 has the branch q -> (p,p) but there is no transition (q,a,{p})
did you forget this transition?"

There is a typo in \rho_1,  one should read q -> (p,q) instead.


** R3, Def. 9: "Is this definition of validity of a branch correct?"

Yes it is correct, it is standard in infinitary proof systems [1, 2, 3].


** R3, Prop. 7: "Something is missing here."

Prop. 7 should be: Let A be an APW. A thread t of [A] is a nu-thread iff rho(t) is accepting.


** R3, Definition 19: "What is $q^{\bottom}$?"

Sorry, I meant $\neg q$, the negation of $q$.

** R3, Page 7 Right column Ligne 21: ""Their definition ..." Who are "they"?"

Yes, the formulation is not clear. I was referring to Janin and Walukiewicz's definition of formulas semantics, introduced in reference [12] of the paper.  

** R3, Definition 27: "What is an *open* derivation?"

An open derivation is a derivation having premises that are not justified. For instance if we set $\phi=\mu X. T\wege X$, the following derivation is open, having the open premise \vdash \phi. It is a standard proof-theoretical vocabulary, but deserves to be introduced properly in the paper.

--------(T)
\vdash T          \vdash \phi
-----------------------------
\vdash T\wedge \phi 
------------------------ (mu) 
\vdash \phi



** R3, Proposition 13 (resp. Proposition15): "Don't you want to state that $\pi$ ($\theta$) is thin?"

Yes thank you, it is an omission.

4) References.


** R3: "A reference that I was missing is the paper by Enqvist, Seifan and
Venema in CSL 2016, [...]. In particular, Theorem 1 in the current submission looks
very much like their Proposition 24."

Thank you for the reference. It is indeed a work that has to be mentioned.
When I was attending CSL 2016, I asked Fatemeh Seifan whether their proof is constructive 
and her answer was no, since it follows the same lines as Walukiewicz's proof.
