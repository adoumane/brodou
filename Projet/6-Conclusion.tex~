\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}


\paragraph{Contributions.}
We have given a new completeness argument for the linear time $\mu$-calculus.
We have done so in \muLK, a cousin of the well-understood proof system 
\muMALL. This proof system has a complete, well-developed proof theory.
It notably enjoys cut elimination, and its proofs are checkable in polynomial 
time.

Unlike the proof of completeness for linear time 
$\mu$-calculus \cite{kaivola95concur},
our argument is constructive and gives a central role to circular proofs.
\paragraph{Future work.} We are considering several directions for further 
investigation. 
It would also be interesting to investigate the efficiency of the algorithm
underlying our argument. We are also interested in giving a proper proof-theoretical status to \muLKo.
We believe that the precise structure of this proof system makes it a good 
candidate to investigate important properties such as cut elimination
and focalisation; cut elimination for circular proof systems
is an open question beyond the purely additive calculus
of~\cite{fortier13csl}.
This would make it possible to propose circular proofs as proof certificates
themselves; although non-trivial to check, such
proofs can be simpler to produce and smaller, as seen in this study.
